# EzBorrow

A MERNstack educational web application for automatic equipment borrowing, approving and managing processes, which is made to offer a replacement for the old manual equipment borrowing process at RMIT. The system includes 3 roles student, lecturer and technician. Students and lecturers can manage their carts and make requests. Requests will be then handled by lecturers, they can approve or disapprove their responsible requests. After getting approval from the lecturer, requests will then be visible to the technician to confirm the pickup date. Each process of receiving a request, approval, rejection or reminder of returning components will be notified by email.
